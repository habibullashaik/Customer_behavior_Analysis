📊 Data Analytics Project
🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow — from loading and cleaning data to exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL-based querying, and presenting insights using an interactive dashboard and presentation (via Gamma).
It highlights practical data handling, visualization, and analytical skills using Python and SQL.

📁 Dataset

Name: [Replace with dataset name, e.g., “Customer Purchase Behavior Dataset”]

Source: [Mention the source, e.g., Kaggle / internal source / provided CSV]

Description: Contains information such as customer demographics, purchases, and product details.

Size: [e.g., 10,000 rows × 12 columns]

🔍 Steps Involved
1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset using pandas.read_csv().

Verified basic structure using .info(), .describe(), and .head().

2. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values using fillna() / dropna().

Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns.

Standardized data types for consistency.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis.

Visualized distributions, correlations, and trends.

Identified key insights and outliers using boxplots, histograms, and heatmaps.

4. SQL Query Analysis

Connected the cleaned dataset to an SQL database.

Executed queries to:

Filter and group data.

Aggregate metrics like average spending, customer retention, etc.

Identify top-performing categories and trends.

5. Dashboard Creation

Designed visual dashboards to summarize findings (using Gamma).

Included KPIs, visual insights, and conclusions for easy understanding.

6. Presentation

Created a Gamma Presentation summarizing:

Problem statement

Data insights

Visual trends

Final recommendations

📈 Results & Insights

Identified key performance trends and customer behavior patterns.

Improved data accuracy and interpretability through cleaning.

Derived actionable insights that can support decision-making.

(You can add 2–3 bullet points summarizing real results once your project is complete.)
